# Project Description

Crazy Emoji is a collaborative online party game inspired by charades where players describe words using only emojis. The goal is to entertain by bringing people together in real-time game rooms where creativity and quick thinking matter.

In each round, one player is assigned a secret word and a set of emojis. That player chooses emojis to represent the word, while the rest of the players try to guess it. Points are awarded to players who guess correctly — with extra points for faster guesses.

The game supports multiple categories, leaderboards, and player profiles, making it a social and replayable experience. Crazy Emoji is designed to be easy to join, engaging and fun to play in groups.

# Branch Naming Rules

## Pattern:

`[initials]/[issueNumber]_[ShortTitle]_BasedOnMain`

*Example:*<br>
**Developer:** Rokas Braidokas<br>
**Issue:** #8<br>
**Task:** Rules for branches

*Branch name:*
`rb/8_RulesForBranches_BasedOnMain`

## Rules:

1. **Initials:** Your initials go first (rb for Rokas Braidokas).
2. **Issue Number:** Add the number of the issue (8).
3. **Short Title:** A simplified descriptive title (RulesForBranches).
4. **Base Branch:** Always indicate it is based on main (BasedOnMain).
5. **Format:** Use / to separate initials from the rest, _ for other parts.
